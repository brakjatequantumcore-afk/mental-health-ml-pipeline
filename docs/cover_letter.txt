I have designed a complete project simulating HIPAA-compliant pipelines for large-scale ML training, using tools such as Spark, AWS-like data lakes, and Streamlit dashboards. My approach prioritizes data quality, lineage tracking, and integration with MLOps pipelinesâ€”aligned with your vision for transforming mental healthcare.

Please find my project and technical demonstrations in my portfolio. I am confident this hands-on approach and passion for meaningful data engineering will contribute directly to your mission.

Sincerely,
